### Task 4.3
# File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in
# [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
# 1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
# ```python

# def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):

import csv

        write_ = csv.writer(fileout)
